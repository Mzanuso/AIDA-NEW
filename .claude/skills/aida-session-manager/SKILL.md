# AIDA Session Manager

## Purpose

This skill manages AIDA project sessions to ensure:
- Every session starts from the correct continuation point
- Status files are automatically updated at session end
- No duplicate work is proposed
- Git commits track session progress
- Context is preserved across sessions

## When to Activate

**ALWAYS activate when:**
- User says "inizia sessione"
- User says "fine sessione"
- User mentions starting work on AIDA project
- You detect this is an AIDA project session (check for `.flow/` directory)

## Instructions

### SESSION START: "inizia sessione"

When user says "inizia sessione", follow these steps EXACTLY:

#### STEP 1: Read Context Files (MANDATORY)

```bash
# Read these files in order:
1. D:\AIDA-NEW\.flow\current.md (ENTIRE FILE - ~280 lines)
2. D:\AIDA-NEW\.flow\memory.md (ENTIRE FILE - ~40 lines)
```

**DO NOT:**
- Skip reading these files
- Ask "how can I help?"
- Propose generic tasks

#### STEP 2: Parse Status (MANDATORY)

Extract from `current.md`:
- **Status line**: Is it COMPLETED, IN_PROGRESS, READY, or BLOCKED?
- **Last task**: What was completed in previous session?
- **Next tasks section**: What tasks are documented as next priorities?
- **Completed date**: When was last work done?

#### STEP 3: Propose Specific Next Task (MANDATORY)

**Format your response EXACTLY like this:**

```markdown
üöÄ Nuova Sessione Iniziata

üìä Stato Progetto:
- Ultima sessione: [data] - [task completato]
- Status corrente: [COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/etc]

üìã Prossimi Task Prioritari:
1. [Task 1 from current.md] - [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
2. [Task 2 from current.md] - [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

üéØ Procedo con: [Nome Task 1]

[Brief description of what you'll do]
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚ùå NEVER propose tasks that are marked as COMPLETED in current.md
- ‚ùå NEVER ask "what do you want to do?" - always propose the top priority task
- ‚ùå NEVER skip reading files
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS propose the specific task listed in "Next Priority Tasks" section

#### STEP 4: Begin Work

After proposing the task, immediately start working on it unless user interrupts.

---

### SESSION END: "fine sessione"

When user says "fine sessione", follow these steps EXACTLY:

#### STEP 1: Update current.md FIRST (MANDATORY - BEFORE SUMMARY)

**Read current.md first to understand current content:**

```bash
# Read to understand structure
Read: D:\AIDA-NEW\.flow\current.md
```

**Then update with new status:**

Use Edit tool to update these sections:
1. **Status line**: Update to COMPLETED (if task finished) or IN_PROGRESS
2. **Focus**: Update to next task to be done
3. **Completed date**: Add current date/time if COMPLETED
4. **Completed Objectives**: Document what was accomplished
5. **Next Priority Tasks**: Update with remaining tasks
6. **Last Updated**: Current date and time

**Template for updates:**

```markdown
**Status:** üü¢ COMPLETED - [Task Name]
**Focus:** [Next Task]
**Completed:** 2025-10-23 [time]
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23 [time]

---

## üéØ Completed Objectives

‚úÖ **[Task Name]**
- [What was accomplished - bullet 1]
- [What was accomplished - bullet 2]
- [Files modified]

‚úÖ **Verification:**
- [What was verified - tests, TypeScript, etc]

---

## üöÄ Next Priority Tasks

### 1. [Next Task Name] [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY]
**Purpose:** [Why this task]
**Estimated Time:** [time estimate]
**Action:** [First step to take]

### 2. [Second Task]...
```

#### STEP 2: Commit and Push (MANDATORY)

```bash
git add .flow/current.md

git commit -m "[FLOW] Update current.md - [Task Name] [STATUS]

[Brief description of what was accomplished]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin main --no-verify
```

#### STEP 3: Give Summary to User (ONLY AFTER STEP 1-2)

**Format:**

```markdown
‚úÖ Sessione Completata

## üéØ Task Completato
[Task name and description]

## üìä Stato Finale
- TypeScript: [status]
- Tests: [status]
- Services: [status]

## üöÄ Prossimi Passi
1. [Next task 1]
2. [Next task 2]

## üíæ Repository Aggiornato
- Commit: [hash]
- Branch: main
- Status: Pushed to GitHub

**Sessione chiusa con successo!**
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ‚ùå NEVER give summary before updating current.md
- ‚ùå NEVER skip commit and push
- ‚ùå NEVER leave status as outdated (e.g., "READY" when should be "COMPLETED")
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS update current.md FIRST
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS commit and push BEFORE summary
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS document next tasks clearly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:
```
User: "inizia sessione"
Assistant: "Come posso aiutarti oggi?"  # TOO GENERIC!
```

### ‚úÖ DO THIS:
```
User: "inizia sessione"
Assistant: [Reads current.md]
Assistant: "üöÄ Nuova Sessione Iniziata
Ultima sessione: 2025-10-22 - Writer Agent Visual Storytelling COMPLETED
Procedo con: Test Writer Agent with Real Examples [HIGH]"
[Immediately starts working]
```

### ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS:
```
User: "fine sessione"
Assistant: "‚úÖ Sessione completata! Ecco il riepilogo..."  # DIDN'T UPDATE FILES!
```

### ‚úÖ DO THIS:
```
User: "fine sessione"
Assistant: [Updates current.md with Edit tool]
Assistant: [Commits and pushes]
Assistant: "‚úÖ Sessione Completata [full summary]"
```

## File Locations Reference

**Project Root**: `D:\AIDA-NEW\`

**Critical Files**:
- `.flow/current.md` - Current sprint status (READ EVERY SESSION START)
- `.flow/memory.md` - Critical context (READ EVERY SESSION START)
- `.flow/session-protocol.md` - Detailed protocol (reference if needed)
- `FLOW-STATUS.md` - Project dashboard (read specific sections if needed)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Session Start with COMPLETED Status

**User**: "inizia sessione"

**Your Response**:
```markdown
üöÄ Nuova Sessione Iniziata

üìä Stato Progetto:
- Ultima sessione: 2025-10-22 07:45 - Writer Agent Visual Storytelling COMPLETED
- Status corrente: üü¢ COMPLETED

üìã Prossimi Task Prioritari:
1. Test Writer Agent with Real Examples [HIGH PRIORITY] - 1-2 hours
2. MS-027: Writer ‚Üí Visual Creator Integration [HIGH PRIORITY] - 4-6 hours

üéØ Procedo con: Test Writer Agent with Real Examples

Avvier√≤ il Writer Agent service (port 3006) e generer√≤ script di esempio con visual descriptions per verificare la qualit√† del sistema di visual storytelling appena implementato.
```

[Then immediately start: `npm run dev:writer` or appropriate action]

### Example 2: Session End After Task Completion

**User**: "fine sessione"

**Your Actions**:
1. Read current.md
2. Edit current.md:
   ```markdown
   **Status:** üü¢ COMPLETED - Test Writer Agent with Real Examples
   **Focus:** MS-027: Writer ‚Üí Visual Creator Integration
   **Completed:** 2025-10-23 15:30

   ## üéØ Completed Objectives
   ‚úÖ **Writer Agent Testing Complete**
   - Generated 3 sample video scripts
   - Verified visual descriptions quality
   - All 60+ visual references working correctly
   ```
3. Commit: `git add .flow/current.md && git commit -m "[FLOW] Update current.md - Writer Agent Testing COMPLETED"`
4. Push: `git push origin main --no-verify`
5. Give summary to user

## Verification Checklist

**Before responding to "inizia sessione":**
- [ ] Read .flow/current.md (entire file)
- [ ] Read .flow/memory.md (entire file)
- [ ] Parsed status (COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/etc)
- [ ] Identified next priority task from current.md
- [ ] Verified task is NOT already completed
- [ ] Proposed specific task (not generic "how can I help?")

**Before responding to "fine sessione":**
- [ ] Updated .flow/current.md (status, objectives, next tasks)
- [ ] Created git commit with [FLOW] prefix
- [ ] Pushed to GitHub
- [ ] ONLY THEN gave summary to user

---

## Token Budget

This skill is designed for efficiency:
- **Session start**: Read 2 files (~320 lines = ~2,500 tokens)
- **Session end**: Update 1 file, commit, push (~500 tokens)
- **Total per session**: ~3,000 tokens (vs 8,700 for manual process)

**Savings**: ~5,700 tokens per session + guaranteed reliability

---

## Success Metrics

This skill is working correctly when:
- ‚úÖ Every session starts with specific task proposal (not generic)
- ‚úÖ No tasks are ever proposed twice
- ‚úÖ .flow/current.md is always updated at session end
- ‚úÖ Git history shows regular [FLOW] commits
- ‚úÖ User never needs to run `force-update.sh`
