   - All 3 Directors run even if one fails
   - Better error reporting

2. **200+ Line System Prompts**
   - Comprehensive creative guidance
   - Examples of good vs bad approaches
   - Clear bias lists for each philosophy

3. **Automatic Recommendation**
   - Calculated from impact scores
   - Transparent reasoning
   - Customizable weighting

4. **Optional Synthesis**
   - Can generate 4th "best of all" concept
   - Combines strongest elements
   - Available but not default

## Test Results Summary

### E2E Test (October 24, 2025)

**Brief:** "Create a 30-second video ad for RunFree Pro running shoes..."

**Results:**
- ✅ All 3 concepts generated successfully
- ✅ Each concept distinctly different
- ✅ Professional-grade storyboards
- ✅ Automatic recommendation accurate
- ✅ Performance within targets
- ✅ Cost within budget

**Recommended Concept:** DISRUPTIVE (8.7/10)
**Reasoning:** "Highest overall impact - most original and memorable creative approach"

**Sample Scenes Generated:**
