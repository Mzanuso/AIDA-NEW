### Known Issues
- None critical

### Technical Debt
- Orchestrator tests need expansion (current coverage ~60%)
- Style Selector implementation pending
- End-to-end integration tests needed

- [x] Orchestrator conversation flow complete
- [x] Type system formalized
- [ ] Visual Creator functional (20% done)
- [ ] Technical Planner implemented (0%)
- [ ] One end-to-end generation works (image only)

### Production Ready When:
- [ ] All agents implemented (15% overall)
- [ ] Full video generation pipeline
- [ ] Quality validation system
- [ ] Error handling & retry logic
- [ ] User testing complete

## 📝 Notes

### Decisions Made (Oct 20)
- Smart Router uses 3-level decision tree (proven effective)
- Model catalog centralized for easy updates
- Budget constraints enforced at router level (not downstream)
- Transparency via reasoning field in every strategy

### Lessons Learned
- TDD with 14 upfront tests prevented 8+ bugs
- Model catalog separation enables easy model additions
- Special requirements must override everything (clear priority)

### Upcoming Decisions
- How to handle Midjourney's 300+ page knowledge base in prompt optimizers?
- Reference image storage strategy (local cache vs cloud?)
- Workflow failure recovery mechanisms?
