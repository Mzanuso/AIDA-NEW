# ✅ Documentation Sync - Ready to Execute

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** READY - All systems aligned

---

## 🎯 Current Situation

### Source of Truth (✅ Correct)
`.flow/project-state.json` contains:
- ✅ All 7 agents (including Technical Planner)
- ✅ Complete V5 architecture flow
- ✅ All responsibilities clearly defined
- ✅ Technical Planner marked as "mocked"

### Sync Script (✅ Ready)
`sync-docs.js` will automatically update:
1. **FLOW-STATUS.md** - Complete agent status
2. **architecture/0-INDEX.md** - Full architecture with TP
3. **PRD.md** - Architecture section with all agents

---

## 🔧 What Happens When You Run `npm run sync:docs`

### FLOW-STATUS.md Will Show:
```
📐 Technical Planner - 0%
**Role:** Project Manager
**Status:** design
**Implementation:** mocked

**Responsibilities:**
- Receives ProjectBrief from Orchestrator
- Selects optimal AI models (52+ models)
- Designs execution workflow
- Estimates cost and time
- Coordinates execution agents

**Does NOT:**
- ❌ User interaction
```

### architecture/0-INDEX.md Will Show:
```
## 🏗️ System Architecture

USER ↔ ORCHESTRATOR → ProjectBrief → TECHNICAL PLANNER → ExecutionPlan → EXECUTION AGENTS → RESULT → ORCHESTRATOR → USER

### Technical Planner (Project Manager)
**Status:** design (0%)
**Implementation:** mocked
[Full responsibilities listed]
```

### PRD.md Will Show:
```
### 2. Architecture V5

Multi-Agent System with separated concerns

**Flow:**
USER ↔ ORCHESTRATOR → ProjectBrief → TECHNICAL PLANNER → ExecutionPlan → EXECUTION AGENTS → RESULT → ORCHESTRATOR → USER

**Agent Roles:**

**Technical Planner (Project Manager):**
- Receives ProjectBrief from Orchestrator
- Selects optimal AI models (52+ models)
- Designs execution workflow
- ❌ Does NOT: User interaction
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before running sync:
- [x] project-state.json includes Technical Planner
- [x] project-state.json has correct flow with TP
- [x] sync-docs.js handles all 7 agents
- [x] sync-docs.js updates PRD architecture section

After running sync:
- [ ] FLOW-STATUS.md shows Technical Planner
- [ ] architecture/0-INDEX.md shows TP in flow
- [ ] PRD.md has V5 architecture with TP
- [ ] All files show "mocked" implementation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Execute: `npm run sync:docs`
2. Verify: Check all 3 files have Technical Planner
3. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Sync docs: Add Technical Planner to V5 architecture"`

## 💡 Why This Approach is Correct

❌ **Wrong way:** Manually edit PRD.md, FLOW-STATUS.md, architecture/
- Risk of inconsistencies
- Easy to forget one file
- Hard to maintain

✅ **Right way:** Edit project-state.json → Run sync
- Single source of truth
- All docs always match
- Automatic propagation
- Git tracks changes in one place

**Status:** Ready to execute `npm run sync:docs`
