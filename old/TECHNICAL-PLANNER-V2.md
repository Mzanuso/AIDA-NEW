## 6. 🔄 WORKFLOW ENGINE

### 6.1 Workflow Types

```yaml
Simple Workflow:
  - Single model execution
  - Direct input → output
  - Example: "Generate product image"
  
  Steps:
    1. Receive spec
    2. Select model
    3. Execute
    4. Return result

Multi-Step Linear:
  - Sequential execution
  - Output of Step N → Input of Step N+1
  - Example: "Generate then upscale"
  
  Steps:
    1. Generate base image (FLUX)
    2. Upscale result (Clarity Upscaler)
    3. Return enhanced version

Multi-Step Parallel:
  - Independent executions
  - Join at end
  - Example: "Video with separate audio"
  
  Steps:
    1a. Generate avatar video (OmniHuman)
    1b. Generate voiceover (XTTS)
    2. Sync audio to video
    3. Return final video

Complex Branching:
  - Conditional execution
  - Decision points
  - Example: "Generate, evaluate, refine if needed"
  
  Steps:
    1. Generate image
    2. Quality check
    3. If score < 7: regenerate with adjustments
    4. If score >= 7: proceed to next step
```

### 6.2 Dependency Management

```yaml
Dependency Types:

Sequential Dependencies:
  - Step B needs output from Step A
  - Cannot parallelize
  - Example:
      Step A: Generate image
      Step B: Animate that image (needs A's output)

Independent Tasks:
  - No shared dependencies
  - Can fully parallelize
  - Example:
      Task A: Generate Scene 1 image
      Task B: Generate Scene 2 image
      Task C: Generate voiceover

Partial Dependencies:
  - Some steps parallel, some sequential
  - Optimize execution order
  - Example:
      Parallel: Generate 3 images + audio
      Sequential: Animate each image (needs images)
      Final: Compose (needs all animations + audio)

Resource Dependencies:
  - API rate limits
  - Budget constraints
  - Queue availability
  - Example:
      - Max 5 concurrent FAL requests
      - If queue full, wait for slot
```

### 6.3 Execution Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Greedy Parallel

```yaml
When: No budget/rate constraints
Approach: Execute everything possible simultaneously

Example:
  Request: "Generate 10 product variations"
  
  Execution:
    - Launch all 10 requests at once
    - Collect results as they complete
    - Total time: ~30s (vs 5min sequential)

Risks:
  - May hit rate limits
  - Higher immediate cost
  - Potential failures harder to track
```

#### Strategy 2: Batched Sequential

```yaml
When: Rate limits or budget concerns
Approach: Process in controlled batches

Example:
  Request: "Generate 20 images"
  
  Execution:
    - Batch 1: Images 1-5 (parallel)
    - Wait for completion
    - Batch 2: Images 6-10
    - Continue until done
  
Benefits:
  - Respects rate limits
  - Easier error handling
  - Predictable cost accumulation
```

#### Strategy 3: Priority Queue

```yaml
When: Mixed priority tasks
Approach: Execute high-priority first

Example:
  Tasks:
    - Hero image (high priority)
    - 5 variations (medium)
    - Background assets (low)
  
  Execution:
    1. Hero image first
    2. Then variations (parallel)
    3. Finally backgrounds
  
Benefits:
  - Critical content done first
  - User sees progress faster
  - Can cancel low-priority if needed
```

#### Strategy 4: Adaptive

```yaml
When: Dynamic requirements
Approach: Adjust based on results/feedback

Example:
  Request: "Generate until satisfied"
  
  Execution:
    1. Generate initial version
    2. Get feedback/score
    3. If acceptable: done
    4. If not: adjust parameters, regenerate
    5. Repeat with improvements
  
Benefits:
  - Optimizes quality
  - Avoids wasted generations
  - Learns from results
```

### 6.4 Error Handling & Recovery

```yaml
Error Types:

API Errors:
  - Model unavailable
  - Rate limit exceeded
  - Timeout
  
  Recovery:
    1. Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
    2. Switch to fallback model
    3. If all fail: notify user + suggest alternatives

Quality Errors:
  - Output doesn't meet specs
  - Missing required elements
  - Distorted results
  
  Recovery:
    1. Analyze failure reason
    2. Adjust prompts/parameters
    3. Retry with improved spec
    4. Max 3 attempts, then escalate

Budget Errors:
  - Exceeded project budget
  - Insufficient funds
  
  Recovery:
    1. Pause execution
    2. Calculate remaining steps
    3. Propose: cheaper alternatives OR request budget increase

Timeout Errors:
  - Generation taking too long
  - Queue delays
  
  Recovery:
    1. Continue waiting if progress detected
    2. Switch to faster model if timeout
    3. Notify user of delays
```

### 6.5 Workflow Optimization Techniques

#### Technique 1: Pre-warming

```yaml
Concept: Predict next steps, start early

Example:
  While Step 1 executes:
    - Prepare Step 2 inputs
    - Pre-load models
    - Queue next request
  
Benefit: Reduces wait time between steps
```

#### Technique 2: Caching

```yaml
Concept: Reuse previous generations

Example:
  User: "Generate product photo"
  System: Generates and caches result
  User: "Actually, make it blue"
  System: Loads cached image, only re-colors
  
Benefit: Avoid full regeneration for minor changes
```

#### Technique 3: Progressive Rendering

```yaml
Concept: Show lower quality fast, refine later

Example:
  Step 1: Quick draft (SDXL, 10s)
  Show to user immediately
  Step 2: High quality (FLUX Pro, 60s)
  Replace draft when ready
  
Benefit: Faster perceived response time
```

#### Technique 4: Adaptive Quality

```yaml
Concept: Match quality to usage

Example:
  - Preview/draft: Use fast, cheap models
  - Internal review: Standard quality
  - Final delivery: Premium models
  
Benefit: Optimize cost and speed across project lifecycle
```

### 9.2 Savings Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Tiered Generation

```yaml
Concept:
  Generate in quality tiers, upgrade only what's needed

Example:
  Project: 10 product images
  
  Approach:
    Round 1: Generate all 10 with FLUX Schnell
      Cost: 10 × $0.003 = $0.03
    
    Review: Select best 3
    
    Round 2: Regenerate best 3 with FLUX Pro
      Cost: 3 × $0.055 = $0.165
    
  Total: $0.195 (vs $0.55 if all FLUX Pro)
  Savings: 64%
```

#### Strategy 2: Batch Operations

```yaml
Concept:
  Leverage economies of scale

Example:
  Need 50 similar images
  
  Inefficient:
    50 × FLUX Pro = $2.75
  
  Optimized:
    - Generate 5 variations with FLUX Pro: $0.275
    - Generate 45 similar with FLUX Schnell: $0.135
    - Use Seedream to unify style: 45 × $0.035 = $1.575
  
  Total: $1.985 (vs $2.75)
  Savings: 28%
  Bonus: Consistent style across all
```

#### Strategy 3: Fallback Chains

```yaml
Concept:
  Try cheaper models first, upgrade only if needed

Example:
  Project: Marketing image
  
  Workflow:
    Attempt 1: FLUX Schnell ($0.003)
    → If quality sufficient: DONE
    → If not: proceed
    
    Attempt 2: FLUX Pro ($0.055)
    → If quality sufficient: DONE
    → If not: proceed
    
    Attempt 3: FLUX Pro + enhancements ($0.09)
  
  Best Case: $0.003
  Worst Case: $0.148 ($0.003 + $0.055 + $0.09)
  Average: $0.058
  
  vs Always Premium: $0.09
  Average Savings: 36%
```

#### Strategy 4: Hybrid Workflows

```yaml
Concept:
  Mix quality tiers within same project

Example:
  60-second video with 6 scenes
  
  Premium Approach:
    6 × Kling Pro (5s): 6 × $0.30 = $1.80
  
  Optimized Hybrid:
    - Scene 1 (hero): Kling Pro 5s: $0.30
    - Scene 6 (CTA): Kling Pro 5s: $0.30
    - Scenes 2-5: Kling Standard 5s: 4 × $0.15 = $0.60
  
  Total: $1.20 (vs $1.80)
  Savings: 33%
  Quality: Premium where it matters most
```

#### Strategy 5: Smart Asset Reuse

```yaml
Concept:
  Generate once, use multiple times

Example:
  Brand content library
  
  Approach:
    - Generate 20 base images: $0.60 (Schnell)
    - Store in asset library
    - Reuse across projects
    - Edit/remix as needed (Nano Banana): $0.04 each
  
  Project 1: Select 5, use as-is: $0
  Project 2: Select 3, edit colors: $0.12
  Project 3: Select 4, different backgrounds: $0.16
  
  Total for 3 projects: $0.88
  vs Generating fresh each time: $1.80
  Savings: 51%
```
